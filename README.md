### Description

The speed bug has been fixed, thanks for your input guys. Anyone have ideas on images? I am thinking of BitBlting them onto the picture but the X - Y positions get messed up, same thing with alignment.

<br>

This is a little test I wrote to see if VB do this sort of thing. As of right now it is pretty boring, and only accepts a few HTML command like BOLD, Italics, and Font Styles and I added Hyperlinks this morning. I need help with this thing so if you can, vote or send me an email. There are a few bad bugs in it (like the screen flickering) but let me know what you think so far. Thanks Bryan Cairns.
 
### More Info
 
Nasty flicker as screen repaints, and I am having trouble with the BitBLT code to put images on the page.
